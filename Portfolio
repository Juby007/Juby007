- 👋 Hi, I’m Marcin Miazga 🇵🇱 @Juby007 👨‍💻

- 👀 I am interested in network security 🌐 and individual 
Android Applikation 📲 in order to prevent data abuse and phishing 💂‍♀️
- 🌱 I am currently learning 📑 how to create security
and how to verify ⚖️ data in a way that could potentially 
be the most effective of its kind in the world 🌍 preventing fraud.
- 💞️ I want to cooperate in the creation of security in Cyberspace 📡
which in the future may completely 🚧 eliminate the possibility 
of phishing data 🔐 and using them in the Network 🌐. This is a huge 
problem today, which, in a word, even professional programmers and
abalitics 📊 are not able to deal with it. The key 🔑 to success🏅,
in my opinion, is to ✏️ create 🧩 a common system that works on all servers, 
which 🏗️ will be refined to perfection over time,👥 eliminating abuses🃏🎯.
